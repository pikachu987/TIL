 * AdobeUXAuthManager is the class through which authentication with the Adobe Creative Cloud is managed.
 * This is starting point for using the Creative SDK.  All clients are required to call
 * the setAuthenticationParametersWithClientID:withClientSecret: method before using the CreativeSDK.
 *
 * Using this class, you can:
 *
 * 1. Specify the clientID and clientSecret as issued by Adobe.
 * 2. Query for authentication status.
 * 3. Get the user profile of the currently authenticated user.
 * 4. Logout the currently logged in user.
 *
 * You need to use the sharedManager property for all the interactions.
 *
 * The Login and Logout notifications are sent through the NSNotificationManager class.
 *
 * The NSNotificationManager will send
 *
 * <code>extern NSString\* const AdobeAuthManagerLoggedInNotification</code>
 *
 * when a user login occurs and
 *
 * <code>extern NSString\* const AdobeAuthManagerLoggedOutNotification</code>
 *
 * when a user logout occurs.
 *
 * The AdobeUXAuthManager handles creating the UI for login and account creation automatically.
 * Logins are cached such that when your application starts up, it can login automatically.
 *
 * The Creative SDK does not force login and logout completion block to run on the main thread.
 *
 * @note Many Creative SDK APIs will require an authenticated user so nearly all other classes will rely upon this class.
